			<h2>Our Mission</h2>

			<p>Broke-Ass Students started out as a University assignment with the aim to 'solve a societal issue'. As our social following grew, we started to receive messages from students thanking us for providing them with a community where they could share their issues and help with budgeting. We then realised that we could take this project and turn it into something that students could actually use.</p>

			<p>Juggling university and a part-time job during university can be frustrating and exhausting, particularly if you are living out of home.</p>

			<p>Kiara's biggest BAS moment<br><br>
				<q>I walked around UNSW IGA for almost 30 minutes looking for something substantial that would only cost $0.70. After a pretty wild weekend my bankcard decided to disappear midway through Saturday night leaving me card-less and cashless for the next week until my new card arrived.</p> I considered getting something from the fresh produce section, maybe a banana or apple but without a scale to weigh the fruit I was worried I would get to the counter and the $0.70 wouldn't be enough. I would've had to politely tell the cashier I couldn't afford the $0.87 banana and return it to its shelf. </q>

				<p>Grace's biggest BAS moment<br><br>
					<q>I was at a tech female founders meet up, and went to the train station to get home. As I tried to tap on, the Opal reader informed me that my Opal balance was negative and I wouldn't be able to get through. When I tried to top up my card, the card reader informed me that I couldn't even top up $10. My bank balance was -$12! I then walked for an hour and a half (from Central to Milsons Point) and got picked up by a mate.</p> I asked my parents if they could lend me $20 so that I could afford to get to work the next day which they left out for me. I got to the train station the next morning and <i>realised that I had left the $20 on the table</i>. At this point I had no idea what to do so I called my best friend who drove to the station and paid $4.20 for a train ticket for me. Thank god for friends.</q>
